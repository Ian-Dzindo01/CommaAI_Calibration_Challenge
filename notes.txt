Predict direction of travel in camera frame, from provided dashcam video.

F is 910 pixels (estimation)

Camera is not alligned to the vehicle. We will have to estimate pitch and yaw, which will vary between installations
The best way to start estimating these values is to predict the direction of motion in camera frame.

Generate 5.txt to 9.txt labels. These labels should be a 2D array that contains the pitch and yaw angles of the direction
of travel (in camera frame) of every frame of the respective videos.

Errors where car is travelling at less than 4 m/s will be ignored.

Use eval.py to test your solutions.
